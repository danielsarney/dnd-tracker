Django Management Command for Seeding D&D Tracker Database

This command populates the database with comprehensive test data for all models
in the D&D Tracker application. It creates realistic test data including users,
campaigns, player characters, monsters, game sessions, encounters, and combat data.

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This command DELETES ALL existing data by default!

Usage:
    python manage.py seed                    # Clear everything and seed fresh data
    python manage.py seed --no-clear         # Keep existing data (NOT recommended)
    python manage.py seed --no-factories     # Skip additional random data

Features:
- ALWAYS clears existing data before seeding (use --no-clear to skip)
- Creates diverse test data across all models
- Maintains referential integrity between related models
- Provides detailed progress output
- Handles errors gracefully with rollback capability
